Both of our older sons are now autistic, and were not born so. Patient was a happy baby. After receiving the vaccines, he was fussy, and since has stopped sleeping normally, and has had more fevers and rashes and lack of eye contact. He stopped trying to roll over or move on his own for about a month post vaccination. This is a huge concern as he was hitting milestones wonderfully prior. We did not seek immediate help. We decided to wait and decided to see if he would feel better after a few days. Then he was so sick. Seemingly with one cold virus after another, and then with a horrible cough and ear infection, which we saught treatment for at Health Center in December, No injury report was filed. I felt like no one would listen to my concern. I'm not anti vaccines. I am just concerned about my baby.

738012,1,F,"Monday morning 2/12/18, our little patient woke up with cross eyed vision. We immediately called a Pediatric Ophthalmologist and upon reviewing her, requested an emergency MRI at hospital. The thought of our baby going under anesthesia was so terrifying. To see our little baby in the recovery room with an oxygen mask over her face completely passed out because of the anesthesia was a sight no parent EVER wants to see. How could this have happened to our baby? She was perfectly fine on Sunday. We started to put the pieces together and the only conclusion was this could have been a direct cause of her recent MMR vaccine she had last Wednesday. I did notice her acting fussy Saturday, she had serious diarrhea and thought she was catching a cold or possibly teething. Thanks to GOD the MRI results came back normal Thursday. They did see some sinus congestion, but no major mass or tumors. Her ophthalmologist and pediatrician are both saying it?s now a waiting game, this is completely normal and her vision should go back to normal on her own. Worst case, she'll need glasses or surgery. As a mommy, this is NOT normal. When your baby?s eyes are getting worse, there's heavy green mucus in both eyes, you feel like you?re racing against time, you fight, you research, and you're on the phone to get seen by more doctors. This has given me a whole new hunger to know what's in the vaccinations that are given to our children.

She was diagnosed with asthma when she was six years old and used albuterol inhaler as needed (but had not used it in three years). On 28-JUN-2017, the patient received her first dose of GARDASIL 9 intramuscularly, given by a physician for the indication of ""vaccination"" (lot # N043731; expiration 22-JUN-2019) along with diphtheria toxoid, pertussis acellular vaccine (unspecified), tetanus toxoid (manufacturer not specified) and MENACTRA.  Her daughter reported stomach pain after receiving the vaccine but no treatment was given. The patient received a flu vaccine (manufacturer not specified) on 13-OCT-2017. Then, on 29-DEC-2017, she received her second dose of GARDASIL 9 (lot # N021475; expiration 31-JAN-2020). On 21-JAN-2018, the patient experienced pain in the ear and head, nausea, and dizziness. The reporter took her daughter to a pediatric and adolescent urgent care and was told she had swimmer's ear and was given unspecified ear drops. On 23-JAN-2018, the patient followed up with the physician who administered the vaccine and was told she had a sinus infection. AUGMENTIN was prescribed but no treatment was observed. On 26-JAN-2018, her daughter's condition got worse and she couldn't walk anymore. On 29-JAN-2018, she was seen by the physician again and was told she failed the unspecified neurology test and was told to go to the Emergency Room (ER). The patient was admitted. A computerized tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imagining (MRI), urine and blood work call came back negative. The mother stated ""they think she has acute cerebellar ataxia."" Meclizine was prescribed for her dizziness. The patient was discharged on 31-JAN-2018. On 06-FEB-2018, she was admitted to the hospital ER due to low blood sugar and slurred speech but was discharged the same day without any treatment. On 12-FEB-2018, her daughter saw a neurologist at a hospital. An unspecified spine test came out normal and no treatment was ordered. The patient has an appointment with another neurologist on 21-FEB-2018 (the mother wanted all follow up questions directed to this physician). The mother reported that up to this point, her daughter had been healthy, other than asthma diagnosed at age 6. She added that her daughter was currently experiencing headache, nausea, vertigo, dizziness, sensitivity to both hot and cold water (described as burning sensation), can't feel both legs and feet starting with the knee caps down, numbness and tingling in legs and feet, pain in the neck, feet, ear, and jaw, fatigue, blood in the stool, and constipation. She believed her daughter's condition was due to a viral infections because that's what most of the doctors and nurses she spoke to stated could be the cause. Therefore, she thinks GARDASIL 9 is the reason her daughter cannot walk and now she is in a wheelchair. The mother also stated that if her daughter does not get better in six months, and Merck does not provide any type of compensation, she will sue Merck. The outcomes of stomach pain, slurred speech, low blood sugar and sinus infection were unknown. The outcomes of the other events were not recovered/not resolved.  The mother felt all the events were related to GARDASIL 9. On 23-FEB-2018, it was determined that lot # N043731 is not valid for GARDASIL 9.

It was reported that the temperature was 101.8 and the patient was receiving acetaminophen.

741121,11,F,"This literature marketed report has been received from the authors of a published literature article, concerning a 12-year-old female patient. No information regarding the patients' medical history or concurrent conditions was provided. The patient was a part of a retrospective analysis that studied the impact of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) on the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in cancer patients, along 20 years. The patients included were registered with at least 1 visit between 01-JAN-1992 and 31-DEC-2012. Unique patient-visits (UPV) (inpatient or outpatient) per calendar year, age, and cancer type were obtained from hospital databases. However, non-cancer patients were also included. Patients <15 years were considered ""children"", and at least 15 years old were ""adults"". Children 0-4 years were referred to as ""vaccinees"", and patients at least 5 years old were ""non-vaccinees"". The IPD incidences were categorized as ""before PCV7"" (occurred between 1992-2000), ""after PCV7"" (2001-2010) and ""after PCV13"" (2011-2012). The authors observed an abrupt decline in the incidence of IPD in 2000, coinciding with the introduction of PCV7. It remained relatively stable through 2010. The IPD incidence declined after PCV7 in children 0-4 years (vaccinees) and in at least 5 year old patients with hematologic malignancies (non-vaccinees). This suggested an indirect effect of routine childhood immunization with PCV7. They suggested that continued surveillance is warranted to characterize the burden of IPD in the era of PCV13 and optimize preventive strategies in highly immunocompromised patients. On 06-JAN-1993, the patient was vaccinated with a dose of PNEUMOVAX 23 injection (dose and route of administration were not reported). There were no concomitant therapies reported. On 28-DEC-1993 (""before PCV7""), the patient was found to have invasive pneumococcal disease (type 6; one of the vaccine serogroups). The patient was hospitalized due to the event on an unknown date. No prescription drug treatment was required, however it was reported that the patient required unspecified medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the serious outcomes. She recovered from the event on 12-JAN-1994. The authors considered the event of invasive pneumococcal disease to be medically significant, life-threatening and related to the vaccination with PNEUMOVAX 23.

741414,1,M,"This literature report has been received from the authors of a published article. In this case series, the authors described seven immunized healthy children without a history of primary varicella who presented with herpes zoster that correlated with the vaccination site of live attenuated varicella-zoster vaccine. These cases highlight the varied clinical presentations and diagnostic and therapeutic considerations for herpes zoster in healthy children. Seven vaccinated healthy children without underlying immunodeficiency presented with herpes zoster in the limb that correlated with the vaccination site. Their clinical histories are summarized. Each patient underwent varicella zoster vaccination at 12 to 14 months of age. The pediatrician's office confirmed the site of vaccination in six patients and the parents in the seventh. Median age at presentation was 3 years (range 1.5-6 years). There were no precipitating factors elicited by history in five patients; one patient developed the rash at the site of recent influenza vaccination and one patient developed the rash after surgery. The morphology of the lesions included erythematous papules, pseudovesicles, pustules, and plaques, with associated pain in two patients and pruritus in three. Systemic symptoms ranged from none to low-grade fevers, upper respiratory symptoms, and joint pain. Clinical and laboratory findings, specifically positive direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing, were consistent with herpes zoster in four cases; because of distinct similarities in the clinical examination, DFA testing was not conducted in the other three cases. Acyclovir was prescribed for five patients but deferred in two because of the mild or late presentation. The evaluating physician's differential diagnosis in the seven cases included viral exanthem, eczema herpeticum, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, microcystic lymphatic malformation, herpes simplex infection, and herpes zoster infection. In one patient with knee pain, there was initial concern for septic hip, but inflammatory markers were not elevated, joint effusion was not seen on ultrasound, and the rash and knee pain self-resolved after several days. This report refers to a 1 (reported as 1.5) year old male patient without a history of primary varicella. On an unknown date, the patient was vaccinated with varicella-zoster vaccine (code as varicella virus vaccine live (Oka/Merck) (manufacturer unknown), Zoster Vaccine Live (manufacturer unknown) and Measles, Mumps, Rubella and Varicella (Oka-Merck) Virus Vaccine Live (manufacturer unknown)) (dose and route unknown, left leg) for prophylaxis. On an unknown date (reported as 6 months later), the patient experienced herpes zoster in left leg (in L3-L5 dermatomal distribution) (no symptoms specified by the reporter). The direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing was positive. The patient did not receive acyclovir treatment for the event. The outcome of the event was recovered without complications. The reporter considered the event of herpes zoster was related to the suspected therapies.

Within about a week the hives started to subside but they didn't completely go away for two whole weeks after the vaccines. The initial hives did go away. She also started having extra sensitive skin after this event. Out of no where we had to choose even gentler options for our daughter. Now three years later, after a lot of detoxing, she can just barely start to handle things being applied to her skin again so she is just now starting to really recover - especially since we've connected the vaccine to the skin issues and started to take detoxing after the vaccines seriously.",,1,MIL,IM,INFLUENZA (SEASONAL) (FLUARIX QUADRIVALENT),,,N,,,

742318,1.33,F,"We first noticed her lymph node swelling on the right side of her neck approximentally 02/17/2017 where it had swelled roughly the size of a dime with no dis-coloration. It could have been swollen sooner, but gone unoticed. I waited around 7 weeks before taking her in since it didn't grow very much in size at first, she had no symptoms like fever, or pain in the area when it was touched or rubbed, and we honestly contributed it to allergy season. However, it started to swell more, so I took her in first 04/07/2017, where they assumed allergies as well at the time being, and prescribed Cetirizine HCI 1MG/ML which we gave her as directed. It's important to note that on this visit, they also went ahead and gave her the HEP A VAC PED/ADOL, 2DOSE INTRAMU (90633). After this visit, her node began to more rapidly swell, started showing red discoloration and she started showing some discomfort. We took her in again, a week or so later, (I can't find the paperwork when exactly) and they prescribed Clindamycin Palmitate HCI 75MG/5ML which we took as directed for the course of time directed. We brought her back in 04/27/2017 where they started her on Amoxicillin-Pot Clavulanate 600-42.9MG/5ML, which we started giving as directed, but after 5 days I stopped it after it gave her thrush, made her more irritable, and I simply wasn't convinced it, or the previous medication was working, and wanted better answers as to why this may be happening. We were then sent to Medical Center at their ENT department to see NP where they prescribed taking Clarithromycin (BIAXIN) 50 MG/ML until her appointment with Dr. on 05/17/2017. I was still insistant that medication wasn't working, as it kept giving her diarrhea, thrush, and horrible rashes, and wanted a hospital visit to find out what was wrong since everyone seemed stumped. I asked of course, if it had anything to do with vaccines, but the notion was shut down by every doctor I asked. We were admitted to the Medical Center. After several tests, to include a sonogram, they still couldn't determine what caused the reaction, but concluded it wasn't systemic, which is why medications weren't working, and essentially the lymph node had become like a cyst. We were told to give her Azithromycin 40 MG/ML for 4 days, which I did as directed, and to allow the node (which at this point was about the size of a silver dollar and completely red with some purple, and seemed to cause discomfort when we touched it.) to simpy pop and drain on its own. Which it did a few days later in the middle of the night. Dr. recommended a type of cosmetic surgery upon our visit to him on 05/17/2017, which I turned down. Since then, we've been instructed to let it heal on its own, and ""see what it does"". No one still seems to know or accept what truly caused it in the first place, or what any long term damage might be yet, and it hasn't been further addressed since the follow-up appointment after the hospital visit.

Immunity to hepatitis B had been previously documented. The patient had no known history of asthma, allergies, atopic dermatitis, or allergic rhinitis; no other infections were noted in the patient's history. Moreover, the patient was not receiving any medications.

The third dose (re-immunization) VARIVAX was given at 14 years of age. It was reported that peripheral blood samples (5 ml) were collected. Data were reported as ratios as follows: ranges for varicella zoster virus (VZV) Ab IgG: negative <0.91, positive >1.09; VZV Ab IgM: negative < 0.901, positive > 1.09. On an unspecified date in May 2017, the ranges of post-re-immunization bloods for VZV IgG Abs changed to negative < 135.00; 135.00–164.99 equivocal; >165.00 positive. Prior to re-immunization, VZV IgG Ab levels were negative (< 0.90 Ab index) and VZV IgM VZV Ab levels were also negative (= 0.90 Ab index) indicating either no prior exposure to VZV or lack of a specific immune response to immunization. However, 1 week post-re-immunization VZV IgG Ab levels were positive (690.70 Ab index) and VZV IgM Ab levels were negative (= 0.90 Ab index). For weeks 2–8, VZV IgG Ab was present, while VZV IgM levels were negative (-), except for week 8, where VZV IgM levels were positive (0.99 Ab index). In contrast, VZV IgE Ab levels were undetectable pre- and post-re-immunization. Measles Ab IgG levels were < 25.00 AU/ml (range <25.00 negative, 25.00–29.99 equivocal, >29.99 positive). Mumps Ab IgG levels were 17.90 AU/ml (range < 9.00 negative, 9.00–10.99 equivocal, >10.99 positive). Rubella Ab IgG levels were < 0.90 Ab index (range <0.90 negative, 0.90–0.99 equivocal, = 1.00 positive). Pre-re-immunization, distributions of lymphocyte subpopulations (CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+, CD19+, CD4+CD60+, CD8+CD60+) in the peripheral blood of the patient were all within normal ranges. However, post-re-immunization (4 weeks), numbers of T cell subpopulations remained unchanged, while CD19+ B cells increased 48% post-re-immunization (8 weeks), the numbers of T cell subpopulations remained unchanged, while the numbers of CD19+ B cells decreased slightly (6%). It was reported that the patient received two doses of M-M-R II, but had negative responses for measles and rubella (Vaccination failure). It could be speculated that a lack of a robust T cell memory response may indicate the underlying pathology of secondary vaccine failure, which was defined by the authors as a gradual loss of immunity after an initial immune response over a period of years after vaccination (wanning immunity).

742949,11,F,"This literature marketed report has been received from the authors of a published article and refers to an 11-year-old patient. On an unknown date, the patient received her first dose of GARDASIL vaccine (dose, route of administration, lot# and expiration date were not reported) at a well-child visit. She had been healthy aside from sinus surgery and frequent infections. Prior immunology evaluation was negative, but there was a family history of autoimmune disease. Two days postvaccination, she developed headache and vomiting thought due to a viral illness. Her symptoms were progressive, however, and by 5 to 6 weeks postvaccination, there was abdominal pain, frequent vomiting, severe fatigue, pallor, daily syncope, chest pain, dyspnea, low-grade fevers, arthralgias, daily headache, memory loss, tinnitus, hearing loss, vertigo, unsteady gait, leg weakness, muscle twitches, paresthesias, and insomnia. By 7 weeks postvaccination, she had become bed-bound. She also developed moderate alopecia, Raynaud's phenomenon, recurrent oral ulcers, and nasal scabbing, suggesting the possibility of systemic autoimmunity. Eight months postvaccination, she was diagnosed with postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and neurocardiogenic syncope (NCS) by tilt table testing and autonomic reflex testing revealed abnormal blood pressure response to Valsalva and reduced baroreflex adrenergic sensitivity. Nonautoimmune causes for her symptoms were excluded with laboratory testing, echocardiogram, cardiac monitoring and brain magnetic resonance imaging. The autoimmune dysautonomia panel antibodies, NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptor antibodies, thyroid antibodies, and celiac antibodies were all negative. Testing for Sjogren's syndrome (including the early Sjogren's antibodies), antiphospholipid syndrome (with primary and secondary antibodies) and lupus was also negative. However, autoantibodies against adrenergic and muscarinic receptors were detected (Anti-beta-1 adrenergic receptor antibodies: 21.7 units/ml (positive), anti-ßbeta-2 adrenergic receptor antibodies: 11.4 units/ml (indeterminate), anti-muscarinic cholinergic receptor-3 antibodies:13.5 units/ml (positive) and anti-muscarinic cholinergic receptor-4 antibodies: 24.9 units/ml (positive)). The patient did improve with conservative therapy, but she remained moderate to severely disabled by her illness. Small fiber neuropathy was suspected due to her cardiovascular and presumed gastrointestinal autonomic dysfunction as well as the presence of muscle twitches and paresthesias, and a skin biopsy was performed (from the lower legs as normative data were available) to evaluate for this possibility (biopsy results: Epidermal Nerve Fiber Density: left lower leg: 8.1/mm (normal), right lower leg: 8.6/mm (normal); Sweat Gland Nerve Fiber Density: left lower leg:16.7% (abnormal), right lower leg: 27.5% (abnormal). Given the patient's young age (13 years at the time of the biopsy), these results were consistent with a very severe autonomic neuropathy and likely a mild to moderate small fiber sensory neuropathy. Given evidence for autoimmune autonomic neuropathy, a trial of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy was initiated. After four months of therapy at a dose of 1 gm/kg monthly, the patient continues to gradually improve. Her COMPASS-31 score has improved from 46 to 29 and her estimated level of functioning has improved from 20% (mostly bedridden) to 60% (more good days than bad days). The earliest signs of improvement came after the second week of treatment. Her recurrent syncope and paresthesias have resolved. Her epigastric pain, migraines, insomnia, anxiety, fatigue, and cognitive ability have all moderately improved and she had been able to stop her biweekly saline infusions. She continued on monthly intravenous immunoglobulin. The outcome of autonomic neuropathy, syncope, small fibre neuropathy and autoimmune neuropathy was reported as recovered/resolved. The outcome of systemic immune activation and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome was reported as recovering/resolving. The authors considered postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, systemic immune activation, autoimmune neuropathy, small fibre neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy and syncope to be related to GARDASIL. All the events were considered to be disabling by the reporter. Upon internal review, the events of systemic immune activation, autoimmune neuropathy and autonomic neuropathy were considered to be medically significant.",,,UNK,UN,PNEUMO (PNEUMOVAX),,,N,,,

His pediatrician did routine urinalysis to monitor blood and protein in urine. Over next several weeks he developed nephrotic-range proteinuria and was sent to pediatric nephrologist at Hospital. The nephrologist monitored his labs closely and by early January kidney function was declining rapidly so nephrologist ordered kidney biopsy and started long-term immunosuppressant medical treatment.

754358,7,M,"This literature marketed report has been received from the author of a published article and referring to a 7 year old male patient. Objectives: The patient presents for evaluation of bronchiectasis of bilateral lower lobes and poor growth. Past medical history was significant for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with poor weight gain during infancy and childhood, oral thrush, recurrent respiratory infections and bilateral partial hearing loss. The bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showed abundant neutrophils and was positive for Strep pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza. Methods: Serum immunoglobulins were normal with an elevated IgA (369) and mildly elevated IgE (361). Tetanus IgG was protective (0.4 IU/mL) but post-vaccine responses to the pneumococcal vaccine, polyvalent (23-valent) (manufacturer unknown) were poor with protective titers achieved to 3/14 serotypes. Lymphocyte phenotyping was remarkable for a complete absence of B and NK cells. CD4:CD8 ratio was inverted (0.25) and the majority of the CD45+ T cells were memory phenotype. Mitogen proliferation was essentially normal. Due to the absence of B cells and despite normal total serum immunoglobulins, the patient was started on subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SC IG) weekly and antibiotic prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and fluconazole. Clinically he demonstrated good weight gain and a reduction in cough and respiratory symptoms. Results: Whole exome sequencing was performed. A single base mutation in ADA1 (c.320 T>C) was identified in one allele. This mutation (p.L107P) is known to be deleterious and when homozygous is associated with typical severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). However, this mutation was not present on the other allele. Secondary analysis looking for large deletions and duplications failed to identify any abnormality in sequence in the normal allele. But the expression of this allele was markedly diminished causing us to suspect that its function might be impaired. Functional testing was performed and demonstrated that there was no adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity in the patient's red blood cells, thus confirming a diagnosis of combined immune deficiency due to ADA deficiency. Conclusions: Null mutations in ADA result in an absence of ADA function with profound CD3 cell lymphopenia and dysfunction. Clinically affected infants have typical SCID. Hypomorphic mutations may lead to partial function of ADA with more variable immune defects. Interestingly, most patients with ADA deficiency have neurologic complications, frequently hearing loss. We believe that most likely this patient has had some degree of spontaneous reversion of the mutation in the normal allele leading to a less severe phenotype. As reported previously in a case involving a mutation in Interleukin 2 Receptor Subunit Gamma (IL2RG) chain, normal function was not restored and the patient remains with a combined immune deficiency. This case highlights an important limitation of whole exome sequencing and the need for confirming the impact of a genetic defect with a functional assay. The outcome of post-vaccine responses were poor with protective titers achieved to 3/14 serotypes was unknown. The author considered the event to be related to pneumococcal vaccine, polyvalent (23-valent) (manufacturer unknown).",,,UNK,IM,HEP B (ENGERIX-B),,,U,,,

765930,1,F,"This initial spontaneous report was received via an online news article. The article described an infant who suffered a severe reaction to the MMR vaccine (manufacturer not specified). The infant was a one year old healthy baby girl who was already walking and climbing. On 13-FEB-2013, she received vaccinations for MMR (manufacturer not specified), hepatitis A (manufacturer not specified), Hib (manufacturer not specified), PREVNAR, and varicella (manufacturer not specified).  That evening, the mother noticed the baby was irritable and feverish. After a call to the doctor, the mother was advised to give the baby TYLENOL and BENADRYL. The fever continued for several days and on the evening before the baby's scheduled pediatrician visit (exact date not specified but considered to be in 2013), the baby began having seizures. She was rushed to the Emergency Room (ER) where she went into cardiac and respiratory arrest and doctors placed her on a ventilator. The seizures and cardiac arrest left the baby with severe brain injury, encephalopathy, cortical vision impairment, truncal hypotonia, and kidney failure. After months of treatment at the hospital, she finally went home but her disabilities require specialized medical care and supervision around the clock for the rest of her life. The settlement would pay for the baby's constant high-level medical care for the rest of her life. The author of the article went on to say that the government and ""Big Pharma"" consistently tell the public that vaccines are safe and effective.  However, ""the fact that vaccines kill and injure people, including young babies and infants, is not a fact that is in dispute"". The outcome of cardiac and respiratory arrest was considered resolved. It was unknown whether the irritability, fevers, and seizures continued. The outcome of severe brain injury, encephalopathy, cortical vision impairment, hypotonia, and kidney failure were considered not resolved as the patient required specialized medical care and supervision around the clock for the rest of her life. Causality assessment was considered related to MMR for all events. Causality assessment was not specifically stated for the other vaccines. Brain injury, seizures, cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, encephalopathy, cortical vision impairment, hypotonia, and kidney failure were considered disabling as the baby now required medical care around the clock for the rest of her life. Upon internal review, brain injury, cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, seizures, encephalopathy, cortical vision impairment, and renal failure were considered to be medically significant.

Two years later, it was discovered that that test was not normal. In June of 2016, patient had unsteady gait, involuntary muscular movements, and slurred speech due to multifocal strokes caused by cerebral central nervous system vasculitis. She was in the hospital for a week, received daily steroid infusions, and after beginning treatment to hopefully protect her reproductive eggs, she began monthly infusions of chemotherapy in the hospital along with daily steroids. After 7 chemo infusions, she began oral chemo. The chemo lasted for about a year and a half and she was on steroids for a year. The steroids caused high blood pressure while taking 3 BP pills at a time, elevated thyroid levels, and elevated pressure in her eyes. Her doctor prescribed calcium to protect her bones from the steroids. Because of all of the calcium intake, she suffered from kidney stones twice. The first one only required an emergency room visit. The second one required surgery and a hospital stay. Even though she was taking the calcium, the steroids caused avascular necrosis of the femoral head (hip bone) and she had to have a surgery called core decompression and bone grafting. She was on crutches for a month. The orthopedic doctor said she'll probably have to have a hip replacement in the future and she has constant hip pain. Last summer, it was discovered that the vasculitis caused moyamoya of her brain. She had 2 surgeries (one of each side of her brain) called pail synangosis (a grafting of blood vessels). She was weaned from the chemo in June, went for a follow up visit with the neurologist last week, and the neurologist said he thinks the vasculitis is back, based on her symptoms of headaches, involuntary muscular movements, and weakness again. She has had 2 steroid infusions in 2 weeks. The doctor recommended chemotherapy again, but my daughter doesn't want to start that all over again. She said she would rather die. She's having mental issues now, such as anxiety, depression, and hopelessness. She has seen a neuropsychologist for these feelings and is trying different meds to hopefully combat these feelings.

774820,14,F,"Initial information received on 22-Sep-2018 regarding an unsolicited valid serious case issued from a literature article (extracted from VAERS). Literature Abstract: Aim: To characterize cases of myocarditis (MC) and pericarditis (PC) recorded in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Methods: Cases were extracted from VAERS (2011-2015) and assessed for causality using standardized WHO algorithm. Disproportionality analysis was performed through reporting odds ratio (ROR) with 95%CI. Database was also searched. Results: In VAERS, 199 cases of MC or PC were collected, among which 149 reported smallpox vaccine. The remaining were: 15 cases in 'YOUNGER GROUP' (YG; b18 years old) and 35 in 'OLDER GROUP' (OG; N18 years old). Main reported vaccines were against Human Papilloma Virus (n = 6) in YG and influenza (n = 16) in OG. Causality always resulted ""undeterminate"" for YG, whereas either ""undetermined"" (30 cases) and ""correlated"" (3 cases) for OG. Statistically significant ROR was found in YG for meningococcal vaccine (ROR = 3.55; 95%CI = 1.23-10.24) and in OG for thyphoid vaccine (11.13; 7.73-16.03), Japanese encephalitis vaccine (8.54; 2.7-27.01), anthrax (25.5; 18.8-34.5), and, as expected, smallpox (71.88; 49.25-104.89). In database, 91 articles were found: positive/possible causality was frequently reported. Conclusions: MC and PC after immunization appear extremely rare; only in very few cases can a role of vaccine be actually identified. Signals for vaccines against typhus, Japanese encephalitis, anthrax and meningococcus warrant monitoring. This case involves a 14 years old female patient who experienced pericarditis, while she received vaccines MENINGOCOCCAL CONJUGATE, HPV VACCINE and HEPATITIS A VACCINE.

Three days later she started complaining about a sore throat, she was seen at ER and diagnosed with Mononucleosis and Strep Throat. Despite treatment for strep throat, her sleep pattern and behavior continued to worsen, so she was seen again in ER. At that time she was admitted for altered mental status for two days, while tests were performed. She had been referred to psychologist in October when she reported not feeling quite like herself, and has continued in counseling. At the hospital, she was referred to a neurologist for continued care as well.

786173,4,F,"On Oct 29, 2018, pt began complaining of pain in her left leg. She continued to play and baby the leg slightly. We looked at it to see if there was a bump, bruise or mark, but we did not see anything. The next day, Oct 30th, 2018, pt woke up in pain, saying her knee/leg hurt. She had a lot of trouble putting weight on it and I noticed she was hot, so I took her temp and she had a low fever. I gave her Tylenol, and within 30 min she was walking normally and her fever had gone down. She went to school, because there were no signs of any congestion, cough, sore throat, or anything respiratory- besides the leg pain and very low fever (100.1-100.3). I picked her up from school that day and the teach told me she had been fine all day - playing and acting normal, until she woke up from her nap (2:15 end of the day). I walked in and she was on the floor, telling me she couldn't walk. I asked her where it hurt and she said her leg. So I picked her up and carried her out. When we got home her fever was higher than before - 101.5-101.8. I gave her Tylenol once again and about an hour later her pain was gone and so was the fever. She was walking around and playing like normal. She went to bed and woke the next morning (Oct 31st) and has some pain and low fever (100.1-100.4), but was walking. She went to play at the museum in town, had lunch and went down for a nap. When she woke up around 3pm she was in  a lot of pain. We decided to take her into Urgent Care because it was day 3 and did not seem to be getting any better. They sent us to the local hospital and we were seen right away. The began an IV and took blood. They saw elevated white blood cell counts and told us it was indicative of an infection somewhere in the body. They gave her Tylenol and transferred us to Hospital. We checked into the ER and were seen by several doctors - they too took blood and confirmed the high white blood cell count and elevated CRP levels in her blood - indicating infection. They decided to keep her overnight to watch her. The next day, Nov. 1st they began running blood tests for bacterial infection and an infectious disease doctor and Oncologist came in to assess pt and sort of get the history of what had been happening with her. The next day, Nov. 2nd, we began IV antibiotics. We continued on the antibiotics and are still currently on them via PICC line. Over the next days Nov 3-9, we did two MRI's, a CT scan, bone marrow biopsy, PICC line insertion and the only thing they could find was that the bone marrow appeared to be darkened on the MRI - in the same place on both MRI's. There was no abscess, or ""highlighted"" areas on the scans to indicate ""infection"", however they would treat this as Osteomyelitis, since the antibiotics did seem to space her fever out further, and make the pain go almost completely away as well. We left on 11/11/18 with the PICC line and order of IV of antibiotics to complete at home over the next 3 weeks.

No information regarding the patient's pertinent medical history and concomitant medications was provided. On an unknown date, at 12 months of age, the patient received initial doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (wistar ra 27-3) virus vaccine, live (manufacturer unknown), hepatitis A virus vaccine live, influenza virus vaccine (unspecified) and pneumococcal 13v conj vaccine (crm197) for prophylaxis (dose, route and site of administration, lot# and expiration date were not provided for any of the vaccines). Fifteen minutes following administration he developed coughing, pruritus, and facial/lip angioedema. He was evaluated in an emergency department (ED) and received intramuscular epinephrine for presumed influenza virus vaccine (unspecified) anaphylaxis secondary to egg hypersensitivity. Three months later, he developed cough and facial/lip angioedema within five minutes of his 15-months immunization with varicella virus vaccine live (oka/Merck) (manufacturer unknown), Hib conj vaccine (unspecified carrier) and diphtheria toxoid, pertussis acellular vaccine (unspecified), tetanus toxoid (dose, route and site of administration, lot# and expiration date were not provided for any of the vaccines). On an unknown date, at 17 months of age, the patient was referred for evaluation of anaphylaxis to vaccines. Skin testing was positive for gelatin (11mm), egg (9mm), measles, mumps, and rubella (wistar ra 27-3) virus vaccine, live (manufacturer unknown) (5mm) and varicella virus vaccine live (oka/Merck) (manufacturer unknown) (9mm) and negative to influenza virus vaccine (unspecified) (3mm) with appropriate histamine and saline controls. Radioallergosorbent Testing (RAST) was positive to bovine gelatin (25.1kU/L) and negative to egg. The outcome of the event was not reported. The authors concluded that the patient was sensitized to gelatin, and reacted to gelatin-containing vaccines. They mentioned that measles, mumps, and rubella (wistar ra 27-3) virus vaccine, live (manufacturer unknown) and varicella virus vaccine live (oka/Merck) (manufacturer unknown) vaccines contain over 10000 micrograms of gelatin per dose, and influenza vaccines include much smaller amounts. The authors considered the event of anaphylactic reaction to be related to vaccines which contained gelatin: measles, mumps, and rubella (wistar ra 27-3) virus vaccine, live (manufacturer unknown), varicella virus vaccine live (oka/Merck) (manufacturer unknown) and influenza virus vaccine (unspecified). Upon internal review, the event of anaphylactic reaction was considered to be medically significant.",,,UNK,IM,PNEUMO (PNEUMOVAX),,,U,,,
790116,8,F,"When I was 15, I realize now the CFS/ME virus must have been triggered by the Mono virus. I became severely ill which was triggered by my first kiss. I later took the DTaP of some kind for a food handlers' permit. There were many times I nearly died. My throat swelled up to where I could hardly breathe. Mom took me to a Dr. who dx'd me with mono. I got sick again at 16 when I tried to work. It happened again at 18, after I had sex the first time, and I had to have bed rest for 6 weeks. Around 20, dx'ed with ""Chronic Fatigue/Epstein Barr,"" after I got married. At 22, nearly lost my life after childbirth. Became skinny as a rail. It was only years later, after my children with Asperger's had been victims many times, and were medicated for several years, that my son ended up in kidney failure, after Crohn's that developed after he was assaulted at school. The school covered it all up. He developed pancreatitis and was treated like a drug addict by hospital staff. My son was never a drug addict. He was so sick, and dying, and abused. I became ill from repeated trauma after that, which has now disabled me. The pain is unbelievable, yet I refuse medication, so doctors will not help me. I had to fight for dx other than ""conversion disorder,"" which is what they tried to pin on me. Cruel. Doctors told me for years it was ""all in my  head."" It wasn't and isn't.

I kept asking him what was wrong and how he felt, but he could only repeat what I was saying. I cared for him that day. He was very lethargic, and would not even look at me when I spoke to him. Drs. later told his parents that he was deaf, and that he needed tubes and adenoids out. They never caught his symptoms, which were very obvious. Just a few months ago, doctors took out his tonsils, saying they were too big. They have been bullied by doctors who want to treat without looking into his obvious reactions and symptoms of encephalitis and encephalopathy. My son reported to me he'd beat his head on the crib and the floor. Doctors are ignorant and our kids feel like they have to follow doctors orders. When they first refused vaccinations, under a year old, the Dr. made them sign a refusal form, then apparently they sent letters stating they'd better get the shots, I don't know when all he might have gotten them, but the 2 year ones (I assume that included the MMR,) were incredibly devastating. Prior, he'd take his baba, lay down for a nap, no problem. He developed sleep disorders that his tonsils were blamed for.

792159,14,F,"Within 2 days of receiving the shot, she began to have muscle contractions in her right bicep/tricep, causing severe tremors in that arm. They started intermittently and then progressed to constantly, even while she slept. A week later it moved to her right leg and now has progressed to her face. She has also had 2 episodes of her chest tightening, having difficulty breathing and being dizzy. Our pediatrician's office saw her 5 days after the shot when the contractions were only in her arm. They brought in 3 doctors, none of which knew what was happening, but all said, ""its not the GARDASIL"" They referred us to neurology that day. The neurologist performed an exam and ordered tests, all of which came back normal. She said she is not ready to rule out the GARDASIL but she 98% sure it is ""conversion syndrome"" That is a disorder caused by the brain's reaction to some stressor and according to the neurologist, often sexual abuse. Our daughter adamantly denies any form of sexual abuse, but we did start her in therapy to try and find a cause. She has seen the therapist 6 times and the therapist says there is absolutely no evidence of any trauma or stressor. This girl was a healthy, active 14 year old student.

He knew his alphabet, as well as all of his shapes and colors. He could count to 20 and he knew all of his animals and their sounds. Family members described him as 'brilliant'. After receiving his flu vaccine, patient became very tired, so he went to bed early that evening. The morning after receiving his flu vaccine, patient was extremely tired and weak, unable to stand or speak. We believed that the flu vaccine had given patient flu-like symptoms, which I have experienced myself, so we let patient rest. It was my understanding that the flu symptoms can last for up to two weeks. As the days and weeks went by, patient was still not speaking. He began walking very slowly with a pigeon-toed, shuffling gait, as if he was in pain. He also refused to eat or even hold a spoon. Family members were convinced that he was ""going through a phase"" and that it would pass. As time went by, it became clear that it was not just a phase. We had patient evaluated by a pediatric neurologist who performed an MRI and EEG. We have seen several specialists who performed genetic and nutritional assessments. We have also consulted speech and occupational therapists. Being eligible for Pre-K, the school district evaluated for special needs services. The therapist that evaluated patient wrote his condition as ""catatonic."" When patient finally said his first word several months after the flu vaccine, the cadence of his voice was noticeably different ? flat and toneless. It has now been nearly two years since the vaccine. Patient is still in intensive ABA therapy for 8 hours a day, four days a week, as well as two days a week of special education. Instead of playing with toys like he did prior to the flu shot, patient exhibits extreme stimming behaviors. These include constant hopping, clapping, drumming, hitting his chest, or running in circles. Every aspect of patient's life has been affected. Before the vaccine, he enjoyed a variety of foods and would feed himself with utensils. After the vaccine, he refuses to eat all but a few foods, and must be spoon-fed. At the age of 5, patient is still not potty trained, and wears diapers full time. Patient is unable to verbalize any of his needs or feelings. Patient went from being a healthy, neurotypical child, to exhibiting extreme, life-altering behaviors the morning after receiving his flu vaccine.

The next day (11-30-18) they were continuously increasing to the point of being extremely concerned. I (mother to patient) called hospital triage line and they said to take her to ER. We did and she had a few ""episodes"" in front of the resident doctor who talked to the neurology team and decided to admit her for an EEG and possibly MRI. EEG came clear so MRI was dismissed. However, a follow up with neurology and optometry was recommended. Patient's seizure like activity has almost completely disappeared. However, she does have some random shakes and jerks now.

Four days after the rash started he was presenting with fevers over 103° F.

We then went to a holistic nutritionist to get a second opinion and they said it was absolutely not scabies and did cold laser treatment on his body. They thought it was fully related to the vaccines. My son has been in daycare and around his siblings with no one getting any of the signs and symptoms he presented with. After that we got in to our regular doctor (at the beginning of October), at this point the rash was so severe my son was itching chunks of skin off his body. Up to this point, we tried, coconut oil, antibiotics, creams, lotions, anti-itch, BENADRYL. At this appointment he was prescribed another antibiotic. 3 days later his head was seeping pus, and we were sent to the hospital. He was tested for many things and given IV antibiotics and topical steroids but still did not have any answers to what it was and did not get better.
